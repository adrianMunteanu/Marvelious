                        <p>
                            Gabi is 28 years old and works as an Recruiter for a HR firm in Bucharest, which recruits qualified personnel for the IT industry in Iasi and Bucharest.
                            She has worked in the job for more than two and a half years, and already knows her way around all the major social platform, and the ways they can be used for her job.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            She feels very comfortable in her current position, and is eager to adapt and learn new ways and tools which can help her in her job. Even though she spends most of
                            her time on a computer, writing emails and contacting people, she is not very interested in social media and IT in general. For her, the job is the only place where she interacts
                            with a computer consistently.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Gabi's passion is watching movies, always seeing movies as soon as they are available in cinemas. With the current trend of Marvel movies, there are a lot of details which she cannot
                            piece together, a lot of easter eggs she doesn't understand and a lot of characters she wants to know more about.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Being familiar social media, she tried to find more information there, but facebook groups and pages are not her thing, and se searches for a simple platform / application where
                            she can find out the back-story of the characters from the movies she likes.

                    <p>
                        Gabi used a search engine to find apps which would aggregate data about marvel characters and events.
                        From all the apps she chose the most easy to use one, and found a lot more about the origins of Peter Quill, know as "Starlord".

                            Cristian is a 12 years old high school student and and avid gamer. He spends most of his time re-playing old games and at the same time trying new ones.
                            For as long as he remembers he has a PC and always loved to tinker with it. Either by changing a piece of hardware or playing around with different software. For some time though, he
                            discovered a passion for gaming, and has played a lot of games.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Recently he got a gift, a Playstation 4 gaming console. While researching what games he could play on the console he came across some gameplay from a yet to be released Spiderman game.
                            He liked the character immediately and decided to read up some comics or some info on Spiderman, while waiting for the game to come out.

                        <p>
                            He is searching for a fun application / platform where he can have some fun, while also getting some info on the characters from the new Spiderman game.
                            Cristian wonders if he will fine a website or an app where he will not be bored while reading up on the characters and the events from the game.
